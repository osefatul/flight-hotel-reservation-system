### Intro
The T&S system is equipped with numerous advanced features that allow users to easily plan and book their travel and accommodation. Using this application, users can search for and select a destination, choose and reserve a place to stay, and book a ticket for travel to that destination or a package that includes both stay and travel. This is an all-in-one system that allows users to plan their trip from start to finish, including checking in and obtaining their boarding pass.

Both the travel and accommodation systems can be used together or independently. We have developed our own systems without relying on external APIs. The accommodation system allows an admin to create multiple hotels in the selected destination, each with custom features as desired. Similarly, the travel system has been developed to offer a range of travel services.
