1 - Created a host server for stays and added env variable.
	cookies were not working: cookies wasn't getting set on brwoser from backend side. in the cookies object just added
		{httpOnly: false,
            	sameSite: 'none'}
	For me sometimes, cookies were sent on firefox header but not on chrome header, then added a secure: true, in the above cookes object and it solved the issue
2- created another host for Travel server.
Reason why Stripe Checkout was not working: 
In the TravelBackend/env I was using "" for domain_URL.. to run it locally it works but for heroku, it doesn't.. So i removed it.
Added a webhook listner such as below for session.complete.checkout

3- for netlify make sure you include _redirect in the build folder and netlify.toml in the main frontend.
