# Travel and Stay System
Travel and Stay is an advanced fullstack web application built using MERN technology upon microservices architecture.

## Overview
T&S system is composed of several advanced features. In this application, a user can choose and reserve a destination for stays and then also book a ticket for travel to that destination or different as a package. This is an advanced full package system starting from searching a destination till check-in and receive boarding pass.

Both systems can be used as a one- choose a destination for stay and then book a ticket for travel to that destination. or just use any system individually/separately.
No external API has been used, rather we developed our own system where an admin can create multiple hotels in the targeted stayed destination with different features as per request. The same way, another system has been developed for travels services as well.
