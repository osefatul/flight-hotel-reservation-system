# Travels and Stays System
Travel and Stays is an advanced fullstack web application built using MERN technology upon microservices architecture.

### Overview
T&S system is composed of several advanced features. In this application, a user can choose and reserve a destination for stays and then also book a ticket for travel to that destination. This is an advanced full package system starting from searching a destination till check-in and receive boarding pass.
No external API has been used, rather we developed our own system where an admin can create multiple hotels in the targeted stayed destination with different features as per request. The same way, another system has been developed for travels services as well.
